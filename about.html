<h1>Hello,</h1>
<h3>I'm Taylor, a detail-oriented web developer with a drive to continually learn new skills. I enjoy solving problems and making scalable and responsive interfaces aimed at engaging users and simplifying their day. I have a passion for building clean design, and my communication skills allow me to work effectively on teams of all sizes. When I'm not working on a project, I'm probably skiing, collecting records or tossing a frisbee around Seattle.</h3>
<h3>Since finishing a Web Development Immersive course by General Assebly in December of 2015, I've been working as a freelance web developer as well as volunteering my skills to local organizations. I'm always on the hunt for new opportunities, so please feel free to get in touch. A link to my resume can be found <a target ="_blank" href="Taylor_Bolin_Resume.pdf">here</a>.</h3>
